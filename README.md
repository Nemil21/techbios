Introducing R360: Empowering Healthcare through Seamless Collaboration

R360, a cutting-edge healthcare technology platform, revolutionizes patient care by seamlessly connecting doctors, patients, and healthcare staff. Our innovative solution offers two distinct interfaces – Hospital and Patient – streamlining operations and enhancing patient experiences.

Hospital Interface: Government hospital staff can efficiently manage patient records by linking individual patient IDs to comprehensive health records. This empowers doctors to make informed decisions based on patients' medical history.

Patient Interface: Patients benefit from timely and organized healthcare services. Upon record entry, they receive notifications containing doctor assignments, room details, estimated costs, and appointment times, optimizing their hospital visits.

Incentivizing Adoption: To encourage doctors' participation, R360 employs a CIBIL-like scoring system. This system rewards proactive doctors, fostering a culture of efficient record-keeping and data sharing.

Prescription Accuracy: At the doctor's cabin, prescriptions and symptoms are documented within the platform. This mandatory step ensures that patients receive accurate and consistent care. Non-compliance results in insurance and medication eligibility denial.

Collaborative Verification: R360's algorithm cross-references prescriptions to identify discrepancies. Anomaly detection triggers a review process involving multiple doctors. This collective effort guarantees accurate diagnoses and minimizes medical errors.

Performance Assessment: The doctor's score reflects prescription accuracy and patient outcomes. This metric helps identify underperforming doctors, allowing for targeted performance improvement and license reviews.

Advantages:

Seamless patient data accessibility improves diagnostic accuracy.
Patients benefit from organized notifications and streamlined care.
Incentive-based system encourages doctors to adopt the platform.
Mandatory prescription entry enhances patient safety.
Collaborative verification mitigates medical errors.
